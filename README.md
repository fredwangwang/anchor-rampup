# Anchor Rampup

Anchor-rampup is meant to house a collection of TODOs for new anchors, and a
place to knowledge drop tips, tricks, and lessons learned by team leads that
have done this a time or two.

**Steps**
1. File a new issue in this repo with \<your name\>  as the title. This will
   provide you with an indvidual checklist that will help you ramp up on
anchorship.
1. After using the resources/completing the TODOs on the checklist, close the
   issue when you feel you're finished.
1. Come back with your new found anchor knowledge and PR this repo with your own
   lessons learned and TODO items that will help future anchors.
